# Swift Protocol-Based Sorting and Searching Architecture

## Overview

This architecture leverages Swift's protocol-oriented programming paradigm to create a modular and extensible system for sorting and searching collections. The design abstracts different algorithms behind common interfaces, allowing for easy extension and interchangeability.

## Protocols

### Organizer
Defines a generic interface for sorting collections.

### Explorer
Defines a generic interface for searching within arrays.

### AlgoComparable
A base protocol for custom comparables, extending `Comparable`.

### BinaryComparable
Specializes `AlgoComparable` for binary search algorithms.

### FilterComparable
Specializes `AlgoComparable` for linear filtering algorithms.

### ListViewModel
A protocol for view models managing lists of resources.

### SearchableViewModel
Extends `ListViewModel` to add search functionality.

### CellRepresentable
Defines a protocol for models that can be represented in a list with a title and subtitle.

## Implementations

### Tools
A factory for creating algorithm instances like `BinarySearch` and `StandardLibrary`.

### BinarySearch
Implements `Explorer` for binary search on sorted arrays.

### StandardLibrary
Implements both `Organizer` and `Explorer` using Swift's standard library functions.

### SearchableListViewModel
Provides search functionality to list view models by implementing `SearchableViewModel`.

### PlainListViewModel
A basic implementation of `ListViewModel` managing a list of resources.

### SearchableListView
A SwiftUI view for displaying and searching within a list of items.

### ListView
A SwiftUI view for displaying a list of items using `ListViewModel`.

## Data Model

### CityModel
Represents a city, conforming to multiple protocols to support various sorting and searching algorithms.

## Conclusion

This architecture demonstrates a flexible and reusable approach to implementing sorting and searching functionality in Swift. By abstracting algorithms behind protocols, the system allows for easy substitution and extension of different sorting and searching strategies, making it adaptable to a wide range of use cases.
